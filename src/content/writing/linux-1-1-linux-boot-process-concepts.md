## 1.1 Explain Linux boot process concepts.

## Boot loaders
In short, a boot loader is, by name, a program that is responsible for booting a computer. Think of a computer in the "off" state. The computer's entire OS, applications, and data are stored in [non-volatile_memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory) (internal hard drives, SSDs, etc.). Becuase of this, when a computer is powered on, the operating system is not loaded into the RAM in its initial state.

It's the boot loader's job to load the operating system kernel into memory and execute it. The boot loader is the first piece of software program that runs when a computer starts up. Most modern bootloaders are two-stage: the first stage will load generic drivers and then call on the second stage (which is different depending on OS), which loads and executes the kernel. In multi-boot environments, the first stage of the boot loader will display a "Choose your boot partition" screen, and then execute the selected second-stage boot loader.

To put it in context: First, the BIOS/UEFI is loaded and enumerates the hardware installed in the computer. Then, the BIOS/UEFI hands-off responsibilities to the boot loader to start the OS.

### GRUB
GNU GRUB (short for *GNU **GR**and **U**nified **B**ootloader*, commonly referred to as GRUB) is a boot loader package from the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/). GRUB 2 has replaced what was formerly known as GRUB, which is now referred to as GRUB Legacy. GRUB is not actively developed any longer.

The GRUB boot loader is compatible with booting a number of operating systems, such as:

- FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and GNU/Linux 
- Proprietary OS such as most current Windows releases and OS/2 are supported via a *chain-loading function*

*Chain-loading* is a technique that allows one bootloader to call another bootloader as if the system had just booted up. For example, when booting Windows, GRUB would initially load the Windows boot loader to then boot Windows.

### GRUB2
GRUB2 was a completely revamped rewrite of the original GNU GRUB boot loader package to handle more modern OS requirements. GRUB2 has since become the primary bootloader for most major distributions of Linux.

GRUB2 has a number of advantages over GRUB, including the following:

- Wider range of RAID and LVM storage compatibility
- Support for newer UEFI systems and non-x86 based architectures
- Live boot support, ISO image support
