## Optical Character Recognition

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text that computers can understand and process.
OCR has plenty of applications - some you likely use day to day. For example: 

- Scanning a cheque, invoice, or receipt, and having that data automatically processed by a bank
- Converting PDFs of scanned text into searchable documents
- Converting handwritten notes into editable word-processing documents
- Assistive  technology for the visually impaired

Another widely used type of data recognition is speech, or voice recognition. Think of automatic closed captions, *Google Home*, *Amazon Alexa*, *Siri*, and everybody’s favourite on Windows: *Cortana*.

Now, where things get a little dicey is when centralized organizations use things like OCR, facial recognition, or speech recognition and process this data behind closed doors. We’ve seen over the last few years that facial recognition has become normalized and even omnipresent in places like airports to “speed up boarding” and “increase security”.

Just last week, [the IRS dropped a controversial facial recognition system](https://www.wired.com/story/irs-drops-facial-recognition-verification/) through a third-party due to public backlash. The IRS contract with *ID.me* collected over 20 million user selfies and used Amazon Rekognition to identify and verify users when filling out tax returns, applying to payment plans, or requesting transcripts. *ID.me* is a great example of one of these *“ground-breaking”*, *“paradigm-shifting”* identity-as-a-service companies that just relies on Amazon’s backbone to do all the heavy lifting and processing of customer data. [I seem to recall another government contract won directly by Amazon back in 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-details-about-the-cias-deal-with-amazon/374632/). This was a $600 million dollar deal to build a computing cloud running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the CIA and serving all 17 agencies that make up the US intelligence community.

Since the start of the previous decade, we’ve been increasingly moving towards this type of collection, where personal and biometric data are being made available to corporations and agencies. 

## OCR on the web
Back to OCR - Optical Character Recognition is all over the web. Like I briefly touched on before, it can be a great method of automating web accessibility when it falls short, and web accessibility often does fall short.

You can see this attempted on Instagram for example:

![Instagram Photo of the Lake George sign](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/insta1.jpg)
{class-postImageCaption}Instagram photo found under the *#vacation* hashtag - *Image obtained from [Instagram](https://instagram.com)*{/}

While browsing the *#vacation* hashtag, I found this photograph of an outdoors, snowy lookout with a welcome sign. To showcase Instagram's use of OCR to automatically create `alt` captions for images, I can go into my browser's Developer Tools (Right click > Inspect, or by pressing F12) and manually remove the image's `src` tag. The `alt` tag attribute is what is displayed by default if an image runs into an issue displaying and is also what is read to a user of assistive screen-reading technology.

![DOM showing the alt tag of the Instagram photo of the Lake George sign](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/insta2.jpg)

![Closer view of the alt tag of the Instagram photo of the Lake George sign](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/insta3.jpg)
{class-postImageCaption}Closer view of the image's `alt` tag - *Image obtained from [Instagram](https://instagram.com)*{/}

Upon exposing the image's `alt` tag attribute, you can see that Instagram's OCR technology was able to identify key features of this image by highlighting that it appears to be an image of outdoors, and was able to correctly parse the text of the welcome sign (*WELCOME TO THE VILLAGE OF LAKE GEORGE*). Neat stuff.

As another example, I uploaded an image of a COVID-19 rapid test that I found online as each test contains a distinct identifiable serial number on the device itself:

![Instagram photo of a COVID-19 rapid test](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/insta4.jpg)

{class-postImageCaption}Revealed `alt` tag attribute of a COVID-19 rapid test - *Image obtained from [Instagram](https://instagram.com)*{/}

As you can see, to no surprise, Instagram was able to correctly decode the serial number of the rapid test and include it into the image's `alt` tag through OCR technology.

## Google and Firearm Serial Numbers

Now, what about Google and how does this relate to firearms? Google, to no surprise, also uses OCR technology. Google will inherently index any text it recognizes from images during its massive web spidering process and as a result, it's possible to search specific text strings like license plates, phone numbers, and firearm serial numbers.

To demonstrate this, I'll head over to Reddit, specifically, the "subreddit" for sharing and discussing Glock pistols ([www.reddit.com/r/glocks](https://reddit.com/r/glocks)). On this forum, many users post photos of their pistols and attachments. In many of these photos, users will position their gun to the side that doesn't display their serial number, or simply cover or blur the serial number itself. However, this is not always the case. 

![Glock pistol example found on reddit.com/r/glocks](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/reddit1.jpg)

It may be a little hard to see from this screenshot, but if I type in that exact serial number into a Google search, some interesting results immediately appear.

![Google search results of the firearm's serial number](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/google1.jpg)
{class-postImageCaption}Google results of the firearm's serial number - *Image obtained from [Google](https://google.com)*{/}

If I switch to "Images"results, you can see that most of the results are from the same gun, the same model, the same serial number, likely from the same Reddit user. You can imagine that if photos of this gun with the same serial number were posted elsewhere (like on gun forums, or other indexable areas of the clearnet), Google would be able to easily archive and connect these posts to the same user.

To further demonstrate OCR technology on firearm serial numbers, I found an image of a Glock on the net and uploaded it to the same private, throwaway Instagram account. If I perform the same trick to expose the image's `alt` tag, 

![Instagram photo of a Glock pistol, with a visible serial number](/images/writing/google-is-indexing-your-firearms-serial-number/insta6.jpg)

Keeping with the trend thus far, Instagram's OCR technology was able to easily decipher the firearm's serial number.

## The Takeaway

There's often a debate in the firearm community on whether or not it's necessary to blur out your firearm's serial numbers. What bad things could a malicious individual do with obtaining this information? A bad actor *could* falsely report the firearm attached to your serial number as stolen and inconvenience you that way, although this is highly unlikely due to all the paperwork that would be required (paperwork that someone posing as the owner would *not* have). Government concerns are also sort of out of the question. The Alphabet Boys already know you own a firearm, along with all the metadata of your internet interactions. No amount of blurring or gun posting abstinence is going to change that.

So sure, there are no *glaring* concerns with exposing your firearm's serial number to the internet, but does that mean you still should? Google and Instagram aren't the only corporations out there that use this type of technology for image processing and it's only going to become more ubiquitous in the future. Even over a TLS connection, behind all the NordVPN sponsorships, if you upload a photo containing your serial number to a site like Reddit, or in a YouTube video, or on Twitter, what's stopping any of these corporations from keeping a copy of that next to your username and handing it over if authority ever comes knocking?

There's also no way to assert that this type of data has no future-value to actors who may not have your best interests in mind. The public has been normalized and desensitized to bulk collection under the false dichotomy of, *"I have nothing to hide, so why should I care?"* The premise that privacy is about "hiding a wrong" is false. Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance. This also doesn't even touch on how trivial it can be to track most people across the web. It doesn't require any special NSA tools, no secret access - just good old fashioned OSINT and one mistake in OpSec.

You have a unique identifier forever marked on a physical object that you can use to tie a fairly anonymous identity to your real life by people with no special access. Practice good OpSec, and in my opinion, keep photos of your guns off the internet.

Be the gray man. 🕵️
