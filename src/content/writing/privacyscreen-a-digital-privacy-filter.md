## Shoulder Surfing and Privacy Screens
When you envison computer hacking, you might imagine a secluded, hooded figure with a laptop in a dark room. In reality, many "hacks", specifically social engineering techniques, are much less dramatic than that. In computer security, *shoulder surfing* is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as PINs, account credentials, and other sensitive data simply by looking over a victim's shoulder as they interact with a computer. 

Shoulder surfing can happen in any space â€” in an office or work environment, at a coffee shop, on a plane or train, etc. To mitigate this threat, you may have heard of laptop or monitor privacy screens; if you've worked in a high security area or travel often for work, you may have actually used a physical privacy screen as a low-cost deterrent from shoulder-surfing and visual hacking. These physical deterrents are placed over the monitor of a computer or laptop and significantly limit the monitor's viewing angles so that only the user interacting with the device can clearly see the contents displayed on it.

I have always liked the idea of these physical security controls. However, as people increasingly work outside of a traditional office environment, it becomes more valuable to have an easily accessible screen filter solution. I have recently taken it upon myself to develop add-on extensions for browsers, and the idea of a configurable digital browser privacy screen quickly popped into my head.

## PrivacyScreen Web Extension
*PrivacyScreen* is a lightweight client-side browser extension I have created to be used as a digital filter to hide sensitive form inputs, inactive tabs, and unfocused browser windows from prying eyes. Whether you're entering sensitive data beside a stranger on an airplane or streaming your internet browsing online, PrivacyScreen can help secure the confidentiality of the data on your browser.

Instead of manipulating the physical viewing angles, the extension has a means of hiding sensitive data through *document* and *input* blurring. 

 ![Example of PrivacyScreen blurring an input form](/images/writing/privacyscreen-a-digital-privacy-filter/privacyscreen-example.jpg)

You can see in the above example, this form's input fields have been blurred, as although they are not password forms, they still may be sensitive enough to want to hide from the stranger sitting next to you on an airplane. Think of input fields that are confidential but not typically blurred on the internet: home addresses, personal email addresses, credit card numbers, expiry dates and security codes, etc.

## Options
PrivacyScreen does its job by finding every instance of `input`, `textarea` elements, as well as any element with `contenteditable` set to `true`. Once found, the extension will automatically apply a predefined CSS class with the `text-shadow` property configured to look like the input text is blurred. Additionally, the extension provides the ability to blur entire pages when the browser window is unfocused, or by the `Alt + L` hotkey.

![PrivacyScreen's options menu](/images/writing/privacyscreen-a-digital-privacy-filter/options-menu.png)
{class-postImageCaption}PrivacyScreen's options menu{/}

In the above options menu, you can see the different configuration options. The extension can be enabled or disabled on a site-by-site basis by either checking or unchecking thetoggle. If a website is set to disabled (by unchecking the toggle), none of PrivacyScreen's effects will apply. All of the configuration options are stored locally in the browser usinglocalStorage.

Additionally, there are four global options that can be configured, each providing a description by hovering over the option's icon. From left to right:

1. **Unblur Elements on Mouseover** - defines whether hovering over a blurred element will "un-blur" it.
2. **Blur Unfocused Browser Tabs/Windows** - will blur the entire page if the browser window is not in focus
3. **Blur the Current/Active Field** - defines whether the currently focused text input field will be blurred
4. **Toggle Alt + L Hotkey** - if active, the Alt + L hotkey will be enabled to blur/unblur the current webpage

## Installation
The add-on has been published on the Firefox Browser Add-ons library, and the listing can be found here: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/privacyscreen](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/privacyscreen). I have decided not to publish this add-on on the Chrome store, due to the irony of using privacy-focused extensions on a browser like Chrome, as well as the fact that Chrome, Opera, and Edge do not adhere to the proposed standard `browser.*` API namespace used by Firefox and Safari. More information on that point can be found here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build_a_cross_browser_extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build_a_cross_browser_extension)

## Contributions
I would love to have some community involvement work on this extension, or propose new features / ideas for privacy-focused browser extensions. Pull requests on the GitHub repo ([https://github.com/odacavo/privacyscreen](https://github.com/odacavo/privacyscreen)) are welcome if you see a way to make this extension more efficient and lightweight. For major changes or feature additions, just open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
