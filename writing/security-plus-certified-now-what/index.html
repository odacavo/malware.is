<p>In early December, I earned the CompTIA Security+ certification. While this is among the entry level of security related certifications, I consider this a milestone in the beginning of my infosec journey. This was my second CompTIA certification ‚Äî I became A+ certified back in 2020 before transitioning to security.</p>
<p>Currently, SYO-601 is the only available version of the exam as SYO-501 retired earlier this year. All of the material I used and recommend covers the up-to-date 601 objectives.</p>
<p><img src="/images/writing/security-plus-certified-now-what/secplus_logo.png" alt="CompTIA Security+ Logo">
<span class='postImageCaption'>CompTIA Security+ Logo - <em>Image obtained from <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security">CompTIA</a></em></span></p>
<h2>Exam Experience</h2>
<p>My overall thoughts are that the exam was as challenging as I expected it to be. I felt very prepared going into it, which I was glad for because I definitely <em>needed</em> to be prepared. The SYO-601 is the most jam-packed version of the Security+ exam to date, and CompTIA expects you to know a ton of the fundamentals. I was familiar with CompTIA's difficult style of scenario-based questions from the A+, and the Security+ was no exception.</p>
<p>I will say however, I was more confident during test taking than I was during the A+. I knew fairly early on that I was going to pass, due to the percentage of questions I was sure I answered correctly. This eased the anxiety a bit and gave me a good amount of breathing room afterwards to review and knock out the PBQs. I think I had over 45 minutes to spare when I submitted the exam.</p>
<h3>In Person or Online?</h3>
<p>I've sat through 3 CompTIA exams in total; the A+ consists of two different exams, the 1001 (hardware) and 1002 (software). The first exam I took was the 1001, which I took online. Due to some known issues with the PearsonVue software and issues connecting to proctors, it wasn't the smoothest experience. Luckily, I didn't have any major problems despite some unnecessary anxiety.</p>
<p>Granted, I took this just after CompTIA started offering the ability to take these exams online, so perhaps the tech wasn't as developed as it is now. Either way, I've heard enough horror stories to prefer taking in-person exams from now on. If you're in a decently populated area, there should be some <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/Test-takers.aspx">PearsonVue test centers around you</a>.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>I'll try to keep my tips practical and applicable. In no particular order:</p>
<h3>1. Skip the PBQs Initially</h3>
<p>If you're not familiar, CompTIA exams are primarily multiple choice. However, each exam will include around 3-5 performance-based questions (PBQs) at the beginning of the exam. From the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/testing/testing-options/about-comptia-performance-exams/performance-based-questions-explained">CompTIA website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Performance-based questions (PBQs) are exam items designed to test a candidate‚Äôs ability to solve problems in real-world settings and are delivered as either simulations or within virtual environments." ‚Äî <a href="https://www.comptia.org/testing/testing-options/about-comptia-performance-exams/performance-based-questions-explained">CompTIA</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, these are questions that get you to perform certain actions in a simulated environment. Imagine anything from drag and drop matching of terminology, looking at a network map and diagnosing connectivity issues through terminal commands, etc. I don't recall the specific PBQs I had, nor can I share them if I did. I did, however, remember having 4 or 5 of them which was on the higher end.</p>
<p>Anyways, my tip here is to skip these at the beginning of the exam. You can flag questions to skip them and return to them later. Because these PBQs take up the most time and brainpower, it's a good idea to get through the multiple choice questions (at least a first pass through them) before returning to the PBQs. That way, you'll have a better gauge for your time management when finishing the rest of the exam. Also, some of the multiple choice questions you've already answered may help you on a PBQ or two. This was advice I heard before the A+ and I've been using it since.</p>
<h3>2. Eliminate Incorrect Choices</h3>
<p>A test taking strategy you can use on the multiple choice questions is to rule out the incorrect answers to increase your odds. This sounds obvious, but I found a number of CompTIA's multiple choice questions offer 4 or 5 possible answers ‚Äî a number of which are blatantly incorrect if you know a bit about what is being asked.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example from <a href="https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus-take-ten/">Professor Messer's Take 10 Practice Questions</a>, which is another great free resource for practice questions and PBQs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pentester is gathering OSINT prior to a scheduled test. Which of the following would be the BEST choice for this task?<br><br>
a) Nmap <br>
b) Cuckoo<br>
c) theHarvester<br>
d) Nessus<br>
e) curl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer here is <code>c) theHarvester</code>. But how could you determine that if you had no idea what that tool is?</p>
<p>First, let's understand what the question is asking. <code>OSINT</code> is the keyword here. In this scenario, we're looking to gather OSINT (open-source intelligence) on a target. Each answer is a different command-line tool that may or may not be able to accomplish that task.</p>
<p>Here, we have a couple answers that can be ruled out based on inferred knowledge. I know <code>curl</code> is used to transfer data to and from a server (usually through GET or POST requests), using a number of different protocols like HTTP. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a>, we can rule this out as it has nothing to do with OSINT.</p>
<p>I'm familiar with <code>Nessus</code> from experience as a vulnerability scanner, and therefore can also be ruled out.</p>
<p><code>Nmap</code> is quite famous as a network discovery tool typically used for port scanning. Again, not really related to OSINT.</p>
<p>This leaves two possible answers, and we've cut down the guessing game to 50% by elimination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) <s>Nmap</s> <br>
b) Cuckoo<br>
c) theHarvester<br>
d) <s>Nessus</s><br>
e) <s>curl</s></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm familiar with <code>Cuckoo</code> being an automated malware analysis sandbox tool, but it's quite obscure, especially if you haven't heard of it before. If you were taking the exam and had these two choices, I imagine you might be able to make the connotation of "harvester" relating to the harvesting of public information. Maybe it's a bit of a jump, but at least you have a 50/50 shot at it.</p>
<p>The key here is to correlate the keywords in the question with the listed answers to cut down on obvious incorrect choices.</p>
<h3>3. Acronyms and Mnemonics, Bro!</h3>
<p>There are a lot of <s>trivial</s> technical things you <em>should</em> memorize for this exam, such as port numbers, encryption protocols, certificate formats, incident response processes, etc. Personally, I wasn't really quizzed on any of the port numbers beyond the basic ones, but you should know this stuff anyways. I should mention, your goal for this exam shouldn't be just to get a certificate at the end of the day; it should be to actually <em>learn</em> these fundamentals and apply them to your future endeavors.</p>
<p>It helps to create your own mnemonics for some of this stuff. It's also useful because you get a small whiteboard (or a digital one if taken online) to write down anything you want during the exam. That's it. That's the tip. But here are some of the memorization techniques I used:</p>
<h4>Incident Response Process - <code>PICERL</code></h4>
<p>PICERL? I dunno, but it kind of sounds like a word.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>P</code>reparation</li>
<li><code>I</code>dentification</li>
<li><code>C</code>ontainment</li>
<li><code>E</code>radication</li>
<li><code>R</code>ecovery</li>
<li><code>L</code>essons learned</li>
</ol>
<h4>Linux Octal File Permissions Notation</h4>
<p>You probably don't need to know this for the exam, but it's good to know. I realized it's essentially just written in binary. If you can count up from binary, you can fill in this type of chart.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Octal ¬†</th>
<th>R</th>
<th>W</th>
<th>E</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>R</td>
<td>W</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>R</td>
<td>W</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>R</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>R</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>W</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>W</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So if we come across <code>chmod 754 file.sh</code>, we can determine that the user can read + write + execute, the group can read + execute, and others can only read.</p>
<h4>Random Ports</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>NTP</code>, or Network Time Protocol uses <code>123/udp</code>. It's kind of fitting for <em>time</em>, with the second hand clock ticking 1,2,3...</li>
<li><code>RDP</code>, or Remote Desktop Protocol uses <code>3389/tcp</code>. Of the standard common ports you'll need to know, it's one of the highest.</li>
<li><code>SMTP</code>, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol uses <code>25/tcp</code>. 25 is a <em>simple</em> number, just like the <em>simple</em> mail it transfers. Yeah. We're reaching here.</li>
<li><code>SSH</code> uses <code>22/tcp</code> and <code>telnet</code> uses <code>23/tcp</code>. Telnet is unsecure and it sucks. But for some reason it gets the higher number of the two. "Nobody likes you when you're 23".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>It makes sense to vary your study material in order to maximize your potential of ingesting all of the information being thrown at you. There are a number of terrific free resources online. That said, I used a couple of paid Udemy courses to supplement my learning and for high quality practice tests. I spent about $50 CAD on study resources for this exam, and it was well worth it to prepare me. By no means, though, is this a prescription that you <em>must</em> spend money in order to study for this exam.</p>
<p>I've listed all the resources I used below:</p>
<h3>Exam Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/CompTIA%20Security+%20SY0-601%20Exam%20Objectives%20(3.0).pdf">CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam Objectives</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the golden ticket. Straight from the horse's mouth. CompTIA lists every single objective that you may be tested on, and breaks it all down into weighted sections. All of your study material should be focused around these objectives. I found it was useful to <code>highlight</code> each topic as I learned it. Once I felt ready to take the exam, it was also useful to go through this document again and ensure I could verbally explain (to a high level degree) each objective as required by CompTIA.</p>
<h3>Video Courses</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&#x26;list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8">Professor Messer's CompTIA Security+ SYO-601 Training Course</a> ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/">Jason Dion's CompTIA Security+ (SYO-601) Complete Course &#x26; Exam</a> ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia_security_sy0-601_certification_training_class/">Andrew Ramdayal's CompTIA Security+ SYO-601 Lab Course with Simulations/PBQ</a> ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's important to have a good video course that walks you through the objectives, and covers each section in short-ish, bite-sized bits.</p>
<p><code>Professor Messer's Security+ Training Course</code> is an incredible learning resource that Messer graciously offers for free on YouTube. If you've studied for CompTIA exams before, you surely know the name. It is a front-to-back course consisting of ~177 short videos, covering every single objective on the exam. You can't go wrong with this video series. You can seriously learn everything you need to know just from this course.</p>
<p><code>Jason Dion's Security+ Complete Course</code> is another good resource that I found to be a great supplement to Messer's training. It also includes a practice exam at the end of the course which I found was quite close to the real thing. It's a long course with over 270 videos, and I found that Dion goes into much more detail about things that you may not necessarily be tested on. I think this is well worth it in the long run because of that, though. Dion connects the exam's topics at a higher level and teaches you a wider scope than what is required. Browse Udemy in incognito, or look for a sale to pick this up for ~$17.00 CAD.</p>
<p><code>Andrew Ramdayal's Security+ Lab Course</code> is an underrated resource in my opinion. I will say, however, I went through this after the above two courses, and I'm glad I did because it is definitely not as detailed. I found that a general knowledge of each topic is inferred, and I felt some important bits were glanced over or slightly contradicted what I already learned. Overall, this was great for high-level knowledge and also included an accurate practice exam. I believe I also picked this one up for ~$15 CAD on a frequent sale.</p>
<h3>Practice Exams</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/security-601-exams/">Jason Dion's CompTIA Security+ (SYO-601) Practice Exams &#x26; Simulated PBQs</a> ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus-take-ten/">Professor Messer's Take 10 Practice Questions</a> ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/security-plus-certification/free-security-plus-practice-tests">ExamCompass CompTIA Security+ Certification Practice Test Questions</a> ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Jason Dion's Udemy course</code> contains 6 additional practice exams that I felt were quite accurate to the actual exam. You also get the benefit of Udemy's interface to review questions after an exam attempt, and Dion provides great explanations for the answers of each question. This is valuable because it's key to understand <em>why</em> your answer was right or wrong, rather than subconsciously memorize the correct answer.</p>
<p>As for PBQs, each practice exam contains a couple of them, but I found they weren't very helpful or accurate. Once I was scoring around 85% - 95% consecutively on these exams, I considered myself ready. Browse Udemy in incognito, or look for a sale to pick this up for ~$17.00 CAD.</p>
<p><code>Professor Messer's Take 10</code> practice questions come straight from his monthly Security+ study group podcast/livestream. He offers four free practice exams of 10 questions each, as well as 3 sample PBQs. The questions were pretty good in relation to the exam, but like Dion's course, the PQBs weren't super accurate. I have heard great things about the actual practice tests Messer offers, but this is a great free resource that definitely helped.</p>
<p><code>ExamCompass</code> practice exams are notoriously triva-based opposed to CompTIA's scenario-based type of questions. As such, I found they were a decent supplemental resource to drill down certain technical knowledge, but they did not quite match up to what you'll see on the exam. Can't go wrong for free.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/">CompTIA Subreddit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The CompTIA subreddit is a good resource to ask questions and review study material. I was recommended the Jason Dion and Professor Messer courses through here.</p>
<h2>Now What?</h2>
<p>I've really got so much more to learn - this was only the beginning. There are a couple blindspots that I really <s>want</s> <strong>need</strong> to improve this year. The first being a decent knowledge of Linux as well as basic scripting. I've used Linux a fair amount in the past, and use various distros regularly at work. However, I know I've only just hit the tip of the iceberg, and mastering the OS more would really help with my job performance and ability to take on more technical projects.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll bother going for the CompTIA Linux+ certification, but I might as well if I'm going to use the Linux+ study objectives as a guide. We'll see where I'm at in a couple months. I'm going to document my progression here.</p>
<p>The second major milestone I want to hit is to obtain an Offensive Security certification. While I work as a blue teamer, it would be really useful to have some offensive security training to more effectively conduct vulnerability assessments and make smarter decisions. I think it would make me more useful as an analyst/engineer. I also have a background in web development, so getting more into AppSec would be great.</p>
<p>Anyways, lots to do. I'm outtah here.</p>
<p>If you took the time to read this post, I sincerely thank you and I hope some of it helped you. Best of luck! You got this.</p>
